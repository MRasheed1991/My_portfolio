           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>n computing, plain text is a loose term for data that represent only characters of readable material but notDid you know that for most solopreneur websites, the “about me” page is one of the most-visited pages?
            Mine is consistently the third most popular page, after my homepage and blog. It’s way more popular than my “Work With Me” page.
            The odds are, it’s the same for your website as well. People want to know about you before they even consider working with you.
            Which should make you ask…
            Is your about page just a bio, or is it moving them to make a purchase?
            Most entrepreneurs get the “about me” page wrong
            They make one of two mistakes. Either…
            1) They struggled for hours to talk about themselves and ended up with a brief, professional bio that takes 2 seconds to read, or
            2) They got really into the writing process and ended up writing a long, winding story about their life, their struggles, their kids, and their neighbor’s grandma.
            Which one are you?
            If you never know what to say, I’m about to spell out exactly what your about page should include. And don’t worry — it’s actually not all talking about yourself!
            And if you fall more into bucket #2, your story is a hugely important part of your about page — but I’m going to share with you some key techniques to telling that story in a way that draws your reader in and makes them want to work with you. (Because that’s the whole point of your website, isn’t it?)
            Here’s how to write an about page that not only tells a compelling story, but also help you win new customers.
            Tell them what you stand for
            Why do you do what you do? What drives you to get out of bed every morning and grow your business?
            You might say it’s just for profit</p>
